# Welcome to Open Data!

This is a collection of authentic open data exercises suitable for high school students to become familiar with programming and data processing. Interactive Jupyter Notebooks are used as the learning environment for the exercises, where, for example, open data can be read, processed, and visualized using Python programming. No previous experience with notebooks or Python is required to use the material.

The material is being developed as part of the [Helsinki Institute of Physics'](https://www.hip.fi) project [Education and Open Data](https://www.hip.fi/research/education-and-open-data/). This is made possible by the [Finnish National Agency for Education](https://www.oph.fi/en) state grant for the promotion of science education and as well as a grant from the Magnus Ehrnrooth Foundation.

We provide training for teachers on the use of open data in teaching. We have organised both live and remote trainings (see an example [program](https://indico.cern.ch/event/797901/) ). If you'd like to organize a training at your institute, shoot us an email! We are currently developing guidelines for easy and quick implementation of the material.
